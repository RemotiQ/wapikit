Most likely, if you are looking at this documentation you must be trying to self-host the WapiKit application. This guide will help you install WapiKit on your local machine or server.

WapiKit being a single binary appplication, can be installed on any machine that supports Golang.

## Prerequisites

To install WapiKit, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- [Redis](https://redis.io/download)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

In case you don't want to install Redis and Postgres on your local machine, you can use Docker to run these services.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


## Binary Installation

- Download the latest release of WapiKit from the [releases page](https://github.com/wapikit/wapikit/releases).
- Assuming you have already setup Redus and Postgres, ./wapikit --new-config to generate config.toml. Edit the file.
- ./wapikit --install to install the tables in the Postgres DB (â©¾ 12) and create the default owner account for your WapiKit instance.
-  Run ./wapikit and visit http://localhost:5000 to login.
